# <README-GENERATOR>

## Description

My motivation behind building this project was to have a small challenge to apply my newly learned JavaScript, Node, and TypeScript. What better way to do that than to make a README Generator.
I wanted to apply my skills to build a project that can come of use to me later on.
It solves the problem of having to manually make a README for an app everytime you make one.
I learened how to use JavaScript, Node, and TypeScript to apply them into building an app.
